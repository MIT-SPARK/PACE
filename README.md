# PACE
Index repo for the PACE project. It consists of two parts: 1) ROBIN, which is a framework for rejecting outliers using compatibility graphs, and 2) PACE, which consists of solvers for solving category-level object registration problems. 

ROBIN can be found [here](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/ROBIN).

PACE solvers will be released as soon as possible.
